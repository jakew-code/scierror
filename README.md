# SciError
Measurement error propagation with Python. 

<i>Lab reports just got a whole lot easier.</i>

<h3>Notes</h3>

Constants can be used in formulas by creating a measurement with zero error.

<h3>TODO</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implement more builtin operations</li>
    <li>Include a linear regression calculator that produces identical results to the suggested calculator</li>
    <li>Maybe design a system to store and read experimental data from csv files, processing unwanted headings etc.</li>
</ul>
